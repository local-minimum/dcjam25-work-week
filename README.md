# Premise

You work at an office in the mid to late 90s.
You are longing for the weekend when you and your friends have finally managed to plan for the last epic session in your DnD campaign
However the company isn't going well and the only solution the boss has to the problem is assigning everyone overtime as much as possible
The company is a sinking ship.

# Mechanics

The player enters the world sitting in front of their computer.
The computer importantly says what week day it is, starting with Monday.
The clock is close to 6 pm so it's time to sneak out without getting caught by the boss doing so
However this is an anomaly hunt game, which means that if everything in the office is "normal" you must exit by the main door / elevator
If something is strange and amiss anywhere in the office you have to exit by the emergency exit staircase in the back

If caught by the boss outside of your cubicle when the boss is in its normal shape you have to survive a minigame where the bosse throws demands (words) at you that you have to dodge.
This is porbably going to be a simple arcade styled minigame.

If the boss is an anomoly and catches you it is the same outcome as chosing the wrong exit, which is you get brought back to Monday and have to struggle through the entire work week again trying to reach Sunday.
